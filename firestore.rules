/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TradeTrack.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user, identified by their `userId`,
 * has exclusive access to their data stored under the `/users/{userId}/...` path.
 * This ensures that one user cannot access another user's trading data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under `/users/{userId}/...`. The `userId` segment
 * is derived from the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Anonymous users are fully supported because `request.auth.uid` is guaranteed to be present.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is implicitly denormalized via the path structure `/users/{userId}/...`. This allows us to
 *    avoid needing a separate `ownerId` field in the documents themselves.
